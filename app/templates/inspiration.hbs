    <h1>Influences</h1>
    <p>Below are things that inspired me and I care about. I hope this can help you understand me better. My passions include: Entrepreneurship, Technology, User-Centered Design, Science Fiction, Outdoors</p>

    <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>I want to create my own startup, it's just a matter of time! My first introduction to entrepreneurship was Guy Kawasaki and his book The Art of the Start. When I moved to San Francisco, everything changed, I was part of a real startup. I learned a lot from the inside. Since the, I read a lot of articles. Pau Graham influenced me a lot. I loved Sam Altman How to Start a Startup at Stanford.</p>

    <p>I learned Computer Science pretty late, half way through college. I've a lot of experience in front-end developpement. I enjoy designing interfaces, implementing them and see people using them! I've been a long way, starting with Sencha Touch and then AngularJS. But I felt in love with EmberJS. Build by the same folks who crafted Ruby On Rails, based entierly on strong conventions and separation of concerns.</p>
