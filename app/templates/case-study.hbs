      <h2>Product Designer</h2>
      <p>I have a strong desire to solve hard but meaningful problems. I developed skills in Development and Design—not as an end—but merely as tools to help me achieve my goals. I worked at many startups companies, and started a few ones.</p>

      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <h1>Dropbox Design Exercise</h1>
      <div class="sub">March 2016 - 3 days</div>
      <p>I applied for a Product Designer position at Dropbox. As part of their recruiting process, I was given a design exercise. I only had one day to do everything, from research to prototyping. I continued working on it for two more days, mainly to build a working prototype. It's a great example of my design process and I want to share it with you.</p>

          <h3>Design Question</h3>
          <p class="design-question">"Design a standalone tip calculator app for iOS or Android. Use the Dropbox Brand Guidelines to inform your visual design."</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to split bill and tip with multiple people.</li>
            <li>Ability to specify tip amount or percentage (ex. 10%, 15%, 20%).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On a piece of paper, I quickly highlighted the main concepts and wrote down everything that came to mind.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>When I encounter a problem, my first action is to understand the space as best as possible. I listed 12 questions that I wanted to answer before starting the ideation phase.</p>

          <h3>Research methods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Competitive analysis.</b> It exists already 10,000+ tip calculators. Analyzing a few of them is an easy way to look at the challenges they are solving. I analyzed 14 apps.</li>
            <li><b>User reviews.</b> Reading through reviews on popular apps is perfect to know what people are looking for, and if current apps are doing it well.</li>
            <li><b>Articles.</b> They are great at condensing information from multiple sources (research, social behaviors, and real life examples).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Research findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The hard part of tipping is not the math but the ambiguity.</li>
            <li>Different situations equal different tip amounts.</li>
            <li>Tips represent a large part of the income in some cases.</li>
            <li>Tipping follows many unspoken rules.</li>
            <li>Different demographics have various tipping standards.</li>
            <li>Tipping is vastly different between countries.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Based on the findings and the problem requirements, I decided to design a solution that would answer the following question(s):</p>
          <p>"How to remove the ambiguity out of tipping? Can we make tipping fun and rewarding?"</p>

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>To guide my design decisions, I created two «personas» based on the research: Dan (primary) and Maria (secondary). Each persona answers one side of the problem: the social and computation issues.</p>
