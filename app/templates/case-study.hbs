      <h2>Product Designer</h2>
      <p>I have a strong desire to solve hard but meaningful problems. I developed skills in Development and Design—not as an end—but merely as tools to help me achieve my goals. I worked at many startups companies, and started a few ones.</p>

      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <h1>Dropbox Design Exercise</h1>
      <div class="sub">March 2016 - 3 days</div>
      <p>I applied for a Product Designer position at Dropbox. As part of their recruiting process, I was given a design exercise. I only had one day to do everything, from research to prototyping. I continued working on it for two more days, mainly to build a working prototype. It's a great example of my design process and I want to share it with you.</p>

          <h3>Design Question</h3>
          <p class="design-question">"Design a standalone tip calculator app for iOS or Android. Use the Dropbox Brand Guidelines to inform your visual design."</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to split bill and tip with multiple people.</li>
            <li>Ability to specify tip amount or percentage (ex. 10%, 15%, 20%).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On a piece of paper, I quickly highlighted the main concepts and wrote down everything that came to mind.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>When I encounter a problem, my first action is to understand the space as best as possible. I listed 12 questions that I wanted to answer before starting the ideation phase.</p>

          <h3>Research methods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Competitive analysis.</b> It exists already 10,000+ tip calculators. Analyzing a few of them is an easy way to look at the challenges they are solving. I analyzed 14 apps.</li>
            <li><b>User reviews.</b> Reading through reviews on popular apps is perfect to know what people are looking for, and if current apps are doing it well.</li>
            <li><b>Articles.</b> They are great at condensing information from multiple sources (research, social behaviors, and real life examples).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Research findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The hard part of tipping is not the math but the ambiguity.</li>
            <li>Different situations equal different tip amounts.</li>
            <li>Tips represent a large part of the income in some cases.</li>
            <li>Tipping follows many unspoken rules.</li>
            <li>Different demographics have various tipping standards.</li>
            <li>Tipping is vastly different between countries.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Based on the findings and the problem requirements, I decided to design a solution that would answer the following question(s):</p>
          <p>"How to remove the ambiguity out of tipping? Can we make tipping fun and rewarding?"</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>Sketching is my favorite way to ideate. I started by coming up with broad ideas that I refined. That way, I try not to stick to a local maxima for too long.</p>
            <p>Getting the flow right was the hardest part. I strived to design a simple yet powerful flow. The main goal was to limit the number of taps as much as possible. It led me to consider keeping the user on the same page from the beginning to the end, and using the scroll as a way to navigate.</p>
