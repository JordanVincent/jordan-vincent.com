    <p>Flying is the most convenient way to travel long distances that would otherwise take hours and days. When flying, we don’t perceive distances as much as time lost.</p>
    <p>While travelling, local arrival time is usually more important than time at home. If you arrive in New York at midnight, you usually go to bed; despite being 9pm at home, in Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>Below are flight maps from the point of view of major cities. To create these maps, I simply substracted the local arrival time by the local departure time of all US flights for a given week.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">East vs West</h2>
    <p>The Atlantic and Pacific coasts are ones of the most populated regions in the United States. There are hundreds of flights per day crossing the four time zones of the contiguous United States.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">At the Edge of Time</h2>
    <p>The United States spans six time zones. When New Yorkers stop for lunch, tourists are still asleep in Hawaii.</p>
    <p>Things get weird when flying across time zones. Flying West feels like slowing down time. And flying East can feel like speeding up time.</p>
    <p>At the edge between two time zones, it’s possible to arrive at destination at an earlier (local time) than you took off. Take Detroit and Chicago for example.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection-header">
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Chicago / Detroit</h3>
    <p class="subsection-text">Detroit is located in the Eastern time zone while Chicago is in the Central time zone.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Going Against Time</h2>
    <p>Most states follow the daylight saving time. But there is no effect on relative flight time because the time changes at the same moment everwhere. Except when flying to/from states that don’t observe daylight saving time, such as Arizona, Hawaii, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
    <img class="margin-top-medium margin-bottom-medium" src="/assets/images/us-flights/phoenix.svg" alt="Phoenix time zone"/>
    <p>Take Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix is located at the border between Mountain and Pacific time. Arizona stays in Mountain Standard Time (UTC-06:00) year-round, but all other states around it change time in Summer. In Summer, Denver and Salt Lake City, which used to be in Phoenix's time zone, are now 1 hour ahead. And Phoenix's time is now the same as other cities on the Pacific coast. So flying to California doesn't save time anymore, and flying to Colorado or Utah costs 1 hour more. As a result, in Summer, all states that observe daylight saving time are 1 hour further away!</p>
