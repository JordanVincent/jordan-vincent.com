<p class="intro">CityDomination is a mobile game using geolocation. Players use their smartphone to conquer the largest part of their city, the real city!</p>

<p>The world is divided in zones which correspond to real buildings: the university, the city hall and even individual houses. But, it is impossible to win alone, that's why players must cooperate with their gang members. Social interactions are at the basis of the gameplay; it forces users to play with their friends and neighbors.</p>

  <h2>My Role</h2>
</div>

<p>I was one of the four original founders. I participated in all the project phases, from the idea, to the launch. I was responsible for the gameplay, the graphics, and all the front-end part; that is to say the website and the web app. I used the JavaScript framework Sencha Touch 2 to quickly build an iPhone web app. Moreover, I helped to develop the server side which is based on the PHP framework Symfony 2. We used a REST architecture and developed our own API to communicate with our multiple apps: the website, the web app, and the Android app.

<p>I left the project after a year, in December 2012 due to a lack of time and my studies at INSA of Lyon. CityDomination has been acquired by the gaming company <a href="http://mobinlife.com/" target="_blank">Mob In Life</a> and is now one of their most successful game.</p>
