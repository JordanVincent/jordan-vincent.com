  <p class="intro">This project was the final assignment for the User-Centered Web Design class (HCDE 537) at University of Washington. In teams of 5 we worked closely with the client to redesign their website.</p>

  <p>Our mission consisted of applying the User Centered Design process to redesign the <a href="http://bridgemin.org/" target="_blank">Bridge Disability Ministry's website</a>, a non-profit organization based in Bellevue, WA. They help people with disabilities live full and meaningful lives by providing medical equipment, case management services, and events.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>

  <div class="columns">
    <p>Our work started with a meeting with the client to understand the organization and their business goals. Then we conducted user research: we analyzed traffic data from the current website using Google Analytics and Crazy Egg, interviewed users, and created surveys. The data we gathered led to the creation of 3 main personas which was really helpful in summarizing the research into coherent stories.</p>

    <p>Although the current website was definitely outdated, the biggest issue was improving the Information Architecture (AI). From the research we notice that users couldn’t easily find the information they needed. To improve the AI, we used a card sort method with a dozen representative users.</p>

  <div class="centered">
    <p>Drawing on the research findings and the new AI, we quickly prototyped and iterated our design. Early paper prototypes were critiqued internally before moving to medium fidelity prototypes in Axure. We tested the interaction users. After few iterations we moved to visual design.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="columns">
    <p>Using high-fidelity mockups, I implemented the final website in only one week! Because the client didn’t have the technical skills to update the website, I opted for a Content Management System (CMS). Reviewing multiple CMS, I chose to select Contentful. Contrary to other regular CMSs, Contentful doesn’t require to use an internal templating platform. It provides the content through a REST API, which gave me a lot of freedom and allowed me to use EmberJS.</p>

    <p>Contentful+EmberJS proved to be the great solution: every piece of the website can be modified, from the website architecture, to every article. I even integrated a dozen custom templates for displaying news, events, staff members, reports, newsletters, and so on.</p>

    <p>The client was very satisfied with the final design and decided to replace their old website.</p>
