    <p>The design was tested repeatedly through user testing sessions at the UW Business School and Startup Hall. Feedbacks from users were very positive:</p>

    <q>Normally I have to google competitors or look through all individual entries in Crunchbase to find startups that are similar to ours. Once we even bought a report that contained similar information for around $4000. Seeing how much funding these companies got in their investment rounds can help us to ask for the right amount from our investors.  I would definitely use this tool and pay for it! Probably not $4000, but I would pay for it.</q>

    </div>

    <p>The game is built around a strong storyline. When opening the app for the first time, an introduction presents DinoFit’s universe and core gaming concepts. Since studies have shown that most people downloading an app uninstall it in the next 10 seconds, the introduction helps engage new users right away. Similarly, at the end of the introduction, the app prompts the user to test their level by doing a quick push-ups test. However, this last step is optional and can be completed later.</p>

    <p>After the introduction, few key elements help in keeping the user engaged. For instance, exercising multiple days in a row will give the user a clear advantage on the game outcome.</p>

    <p>Contrary to most fitness apps, DinoFit is really playful. Subtle animations not only bring life to the game, but serve as indicators. For example, depending on the status of the game, the volcano will release more or less fumes, and when doing push-ups, an animation shows water being pumped.</p>

    <p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/veritabs/nehjgjnfanppoiaikadimdkobpdahnmg" target="_blank">Veritabs</a> is a Chrome extension for displaying tabs vertically. In Google Chrome, when you have too much tabs opened at a time, you can't see the tabs' title or even the icon. With Veritabs, the tabs are displayed vertically, so you can always see the name. It makes it easy organize, delete and create new tabs. It was developed using AngularJS and the Google Chrome API.</p>

    <q>One reason this extension is great is because it allows you to work in full-screen mode, and still have access to the tabs you open. Normally, you'd either have to exit full screen and switch tabs, or use the keyboard shortcuts (great if you only have 8 tabs open, not great when you have 20). Let's face it, when you have more than 20 or more tabs, cycling through all of them can be quite silly.</q>
