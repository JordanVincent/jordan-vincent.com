  description: """
    <p>BitTitan is widely known for its email migration solution, MigrationWiz. But the company is currently in the works of becoming an integrated platform for its partners. SalesAutomation is one of BitTitan’s latest products. It is an outbound call automation SaaS application. SalesAutomation streamlines the process of cold calling leads by offering powerful tools.</p>
    <p>Although migrating millions of files from one server to another efficiently and securely is a very hard task, the real value of SalesAutomation isn’t really in its implementation, but in understanding of the user’s needs. For over a year, the focus of the development team has been finding highly technical solutions to a UX problem. BitTitan only counts one UX designer. His time was very limited and he mostly works on the UI, while the development team was coding. During my first internship as a Web Developer, I tried to find solutions that would improve the user experience of the product. But my reach was limited to the features I developed. I also didn’t have a proper understanding of the users and the business goals of the product.</p>
    <p>Last September, I exposed the problem to our CTO, and he accepted to let me work part-time as a UX designer for the next three months. He gave me carte blanche to improve the user experience of SalesAutomation.</p>
    <p>More than redesigning SalesAutomation, my primary goal was to show the value of the User-Centered-Design process in creating software people actually want to use. I tried to include as many people as possible during the process. I interviewed stakeholders, conducted design workshops, and presented my work multiple times.</p>
    <p>The five weeks long user research period lead to many findings that I compiled into an actionable list that I shared and presented to the team. Although I didn’t have access to any actual user, I conducted the user research interviewing and observing the internal Sales team, and analyzing related research.</p>
    <p>From the user research, and together with Sales, Developers, and Managers, I created four personas. The personas had much more impact than I first expected. They management team quickly saw the usefulness of the personas in aligning business goals and understanding the users. BitTitan is now in the works of creating personas for its other products.</p>
    <p>Then, I created a complete wireframe incorporating ideas from the research and the brainstorming workshops I organized. The goal of the wireframes was to demonstrate how SalesAutomation could be improved if we took into account our user needs. I introduced a lot of new concepts but I made sure to always back up my design decisions with findings from the research. Knowing that it wouldn’t be possible to implement all the changes I designed, I prioritized the new features and created a roadmap. A few features are currently being implemented.</p>
    <p>Finally, I conducted a quick user testing study, to test the software in a real environment by using a Wizard of Oz technique to simulate calls. Once again, I shared the findings with the whole team. It was the first time that we observed users making calls using the software, and it had a huge impact on showing how the software was really performing.</p>
    <p>Working at BitTitan as a UX Designer was an incredible experience. It was my first time implementing the User-Centered Design process on a real project. Although it is always really hard to change a company culture, the project started discussions inside the management team, and helped the development team better understand the users and their needs.</p>

    <p>I used my Data Visualization skills to design a solution to the problem. It is composed of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A graph visualization: to help users see relationships between scripts.</li>
      <li>Clear encoding of errors: to indicate what parts need to be fixed and how.</li>
      <li>A side panel to edit the selected node: both sides interact seamlessly with each other.</li>

    <p>I used the framework EmberJS. It permitted to decompose the project into basic components, each responsible for its own actions. It also made testing easy.</p>

    <p>The biggest challenge was to produce a graph as readable as possible. I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre" target="_blank">Dagre</a> to calculate node and edge positions. This project draws on numerous research papers in order to produce a clean layout which reduces edge crossings.<br>Finally, to render the graph, I simply used D3.

    <p>The management team was very impressed by the result. Therfore, it was added to SalesAutomation first release and advertised as a core feature.</p>

    <p>This project was the final assignment for the User-Centered Web Design class (HCDE 537) at University of Washington. In teams of 5 we worked closely with the client to redesign their website.

    <p>Our work started with a meeting with the client to understand the organization and their business goals. Then we conducted user research: we analyzed traffic data from the current website using Google Analytics and Crazy Egg, interviewed users, and created surveys. The data we gathered led to the creation of 3 main personas which was really helpful in summarizing the research into coherent stories.</p>

    <p>Although the current website was definitely outdated, the biggest issue was improving the Information Architecture (AI). From the research we notice that users couldn’t easily find the information they needed. To improve the AI, we used a card sort method with a dozen representative users.</p>

    <p>Drawing on the research findings and the new AI, we quickly prototyped and iterated our design. Early paper prototypes were critiqued internally before moving to medium fidelity prototypes in Axure. We tested the interaction users. After few iterations we moved to visual design.</p>

    <p>Using high-fidelity mockups, I implemented the final website in only one week! Because the client didn’t have the technical skills to update the website, I opted for a Content Management System (CMS). Reviewing multiple CMS, I chose to select Contentful. Contrary to other regular CMSs, Contentful doesn’t require to use an internal templating platform. It provides the content through a REST API, which gave me a lot of freedom and allowed me to use EmberJS.</p>

    <p>I am proud of the final result! Contentful+EmberJS proved to be the great solution: every piece of the website can be modified from the general website architecture to every article. I even integrated a dozen custom templates for displaying news, events, staff members, reports, newsletters, and so on.</p>
